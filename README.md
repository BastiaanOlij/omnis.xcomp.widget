omnis.xcomp.widget
===================

XCOMP containing an assortment of objects and widgets I needed, Made with omnis.xcomp.framework

Directories are setup relative and assume the framework is installed within the Omnis SDK folders:
- Omnis SDK
 - complib
 - omnis.xcomp.framework
 - omnis.xcomp.widget
 - ...

Compiling under Mac OS X
========================
Our project files for Mac OS X have now been updated so this project compiles using XCode 6
Note that the default XCode installation comes only with the SDK for 10.9 and upwards while combining XCOMPs for Omnis requires SDK 10.6 to be available. 
You will need to copy the 10.6 SDK from an XCode 4 installation into:
Applications:Xcode.app:Contents:Developer:Platforms:MacOSX.platform:Developer:SDKs
After that you can compile this XComp.

Binaries
========
I've placed zips of compiled versions of the external in the folder called XCOMP-BINS

License
=======
Please note that I'm releasing these works, including my own derivatives under an MIT license. In a nutshell this means you can use the code presented here as you see fit including in commercial projects. All I ask is that you give some credit to this body of work. See the license.txt file for the full license text.

I'm sure I'm stating the obvious that this license does not cover the SDK from Tigerlogic, only the code presented here.
